AvailabilityRQ Description
==========================

The availability request is very straight forward. It only requires a
list of segments and a list of passengers. Each segment represents the
route that a transfer has to do, it contains the origin and destination
codes and dates. If the segment contains an Hotel destination or an
Airport destination, extra information must be sent in FlightInfo object
and HotelInfo object.

AvailabilityRS Description
==========================

The response of this method will contain a list of transfers and a list
of rates. The transfer object contains information related to the
vehicle that operates the transfer (it also contains the destination
codes and dates). Each received rate contains a pricing and a list of
options that reference a transfer on the transfer list. All the options
received in a rate have the same price. If the rate is OW their options
are combinable with options of other rates but if the rate is RT, they
are just combinable with other options of the same rate.

  @Opt 1 P Contains a list of Parameter objects. These objects contain
  ionR   a information that the integration needs to proceed with the
  ate/   r booking process. The information contained in this objects is
  Para   a not relevant for the agency but is really important to spread it
  mete   m during the booking process. This means that a parameter returned
  rs     e in AvailabilityRS should be received by the integration on
         t RateRuleRQ, returned on RateRuleRS and received by the
         e integration again on BookRQ. This is very important to ensure
         r the correct functionality of the integration. One of the most
         s typical Parameter's use is to spread a sessionID.
